            <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started with Vulnerability Testing</h1>
            <p>Vulnerability testing, also known as vulnerability assessment, involves identifying security weaknesses or flaws in software, systems, or websites that could be exploited by attackers. This process is essential for strengthening the security posture of a system by addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</p>
        
            <p>There are several key resources that are crucial for vulnerability testing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ExploitDB</strong>: A large, public database of known exploits that can be used to exploit software vulnerabilities. It provides proof-of-concept code and ready-to-use scripts that can help in testing the security of applications.</li>
                <li><strong>NVD (National Vulnerability Database)</strong>: A U.S. government-sponsored database that tracks publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and firmware. It assigns unique identifiers to vulnerabilities (called CVEs) and provides detailed information on their impact, severity, and fixes.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</strong>: A standardized system for identifying vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique CVE number, which makes it easier to track specific issues across multiple platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Searchsploit</strong>: A tool included in Kali Linux that allows users to search ExploitDB for known vulnerabilities offline. This is useful for environments where internet access is restricted, allowing you to still search for relevant exploits.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2 id="learned">What I Learned</h2>
            <p>I learned how to use <strong>ExploitDB</strong> to search for vulnerabilities in specific software applications. By using search queries within ExploitDB, I was able to find known exploits that matched the software version I was testing. These exploits often included proof-of-concept code that helped me understand how attackers could exploit certain weaknesses.</p>
        
            <p>I also learned how to use <strong>Searchsploit</strong> on Kali Linux to search for exploits in an offline environment. This was incredibly helpful when performing vulnerability testing in a secure network that lacked internet access. By keeping an updated copy of the ExploitDB database locally, I was able to continue testing without interruptions.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, I gained an understanding of <strong>CVE numbers</strong> and how vulnerabilities are tracked and managed. CVE numbers follow a standard format (<code>CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER</code>) and make it easier to identify specific vulnerabilities across different platforms and systems. I learned to prioritize vulnerabilities by using CVE scores, which help assess the severity of each issue (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).</p>
        
            <h2 id="challenges">Challenges I Faced</h2>
            <p>The biggest challenge I faced was filtering through the large amount of information in vulnerability databases. With thousands of vulnerabilities listed in ExploitDB and NVD, it was difficult to find vulnerabilities that were relevant to the specific version or configuration of the software I was testing. I had to refine my search terms and carefully review each exploit to ensure it matched the target environment.</p>
        
            <p>Another challenge was interpreting CVE descriptions and scores accurately. Not all CVEs are straightforward, and sometimes the vulnerability descriptions were too technical or lacked detail. I needed to do additional research to fully understand how the vulnerability could be exploited in practice and what its real-world impact could be.</p>
        
            <h2 id="tips">Tips & Tricks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with a CVE search or ExploitDB:</strong> If you're testing a specific software or system, always begin by searching for known vulnerabilities in ExploitDB or using the CVE database. This will give you an idea of existing exploits and vulnerabilities that have already been documented.</li>
                <li><strong>Understand CVE numbers:</strong> Learn how to interpret CVE numbers and their associated severity scores. Focus on high and critical vulnerabilities first, as they present the greatest risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Refine search queries:</strong> Use specific keywords, version numbers, and filters when searching ExploitDB or NVD. The more specific your search, the more likely you'll find relevant vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Update your vulnerability databases:</strong> If you're using Searchsploit in Kali Linux, ensure you keep the database up to date by running <code>searchsploit -u</code> regularly to sync with the latest entries from ExploitDB.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
            <p>These are some of the key resources I found useful for vulnerability testing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ExploitDB</strong>: <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com" target="_blank">https://www.exploit-db.com</a></li>
                <li><strong>NVD (National Vulnerability Database)</strong>: <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/</a></li>
                <li><strong>CVE Mitre</strong>: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank">https://cve.mitre.org/</a></li>
                <li><strong>Searchsploit (Kali Linux)</strong>: Included in Kali Linux by default, Searchsploit is a command-line interface for searching ExploitDB locally.</li>
